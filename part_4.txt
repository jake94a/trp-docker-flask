Steps in deploying code to production:
Pre-reqs: Automated tests have passed, code review has been done

1. Merge pull request in a specific branch
    a. One idea is to merge PRs into a `staging` branch rather than `master`/`main`
    b. this allows us to set up a `staging` environment that can be used without affecting production

2. When merge is detected, build an image of the `staging` branch
    a. Use GitHub actions such as [Build and push Docker images](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images) 
    b. This often relies on secrets which can be stored in GitHub or something like a k8s secrets object
        1. Secrets can include API keys, database host ip/port(s), secret keys, etc

3. Push a built image to some registry, like ECR or Docker Hub. GitHub actions may accomplish this. Run Snyk on the built image to check for vulnerabilities

4. Upon receipt of the image in the registry, pull the image into a k8s deployment object or similar, such as EKS

5. Assuming no issues, the image of the newest PR is now live. Send a QA team to explore it or run tests like puppeteer

6. After testing is concluded, merge `staging` into `master`/`main`
    a. Steps 2-4 will happen again
